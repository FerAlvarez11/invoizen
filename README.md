## Introduction

Invoizen is a web app that makes it super easy to create PDF invoices. You just fill in the details in simple forms, add your company logo, and list the items you're billing for in a table. The app even calculates the total for you. I used a package called 'react-pdf' to turn all this info into downloadable PDFs. So, with Invoizen, you get the power of React and the style of Bulma, all in one handy invoice generator.

## Features

Easy Forms: You'll find the forms a breeze to fill out with your invoice details.

Add Your Logo: Make your invoices look professional by adding your company logo.

Automatic Total: As you list your items in the table, the app does the math for you and calculates the total.

Download PDFs: With the 'react-pdf' package, you can quickly download your invoices as PDF files.

## Technologies that I used
